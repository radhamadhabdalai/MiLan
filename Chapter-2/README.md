# On remembrance of a very honourable day of one of the finest founding members of modern Odisha state entitled as "Utkal Gourav Madhu Babu" 


# This repository contains implementations of preliminary mathematical background for machine learning
The following implementations are done using python 3,8. Students, Engineers, Reseraches, Scientists and authors are encouraged
to write these codes completely on native languages. They should advise and instruct others to write and verify the same with python or C.

Program Lists
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Polynomial root (all roots of simple polynomial, tested for quadratic only till now)
Reference - How to solve a polynomial. Python implementation of Newton’s… _ by #Revathi Suriyadeepan# _ Analytics Vidhya _ Medium_good
The main idea is to find the root of polynomial using Newton Raphson's method. Then divide the polynimail with (x-root). Then from the quotient polynomial find the root once gain and do it repeatedly.

Other interseting approachces will be added later after implementations.


2. Matrix algebra(Will be included after some time) 
3. Eigen values (QR method) and Vectors
#Without using numpy library (Actually they use the QR implementation, that you can write as given small code snippets)
