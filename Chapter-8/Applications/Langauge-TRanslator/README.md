# On the eve of another pious day (Lord Parashuram Jayanti, Akshay Tritiya, Farmer's earth worshipping day and finally begining of Lord Jagannath's chariot's construction) in Hindhu calendar. This has been a good day to post a setup program for Sanskrit langauge translator.
# My objective is to translate Sanskrit scripts (Bharathbarsh) to Odia (Bharathbarsh) language. But it can be translated into other native langauges too.  
# ######################Om Sree Sree Hanumate Namoh########

#This folder contains language translator using RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) and LSTM(Long Short Term Memory)

All theory part and Vigyaan part will be posted here in future.

The basic softwares needed for these applications

1. Python 3.x
2. Numpy Library
3. Pandas Library
4. Scikit-Learn


Objective is to train an Sanskrit-English sentence translation model. This has been embedded as python code notebook.
This may be great pain initially but kindly let me know if there is any issue and send those issues to my email. 

1. Use straight forward- pip install tensorflow=1.14.0.

2. Session issue can be resolved with in notime. That is not an issue.
