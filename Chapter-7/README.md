#This folder contains all types of Neural Network model.

The softwares needed for these implementations

1. Python 3.7
2. Numpy Library
3. Pandas Library
4. Scikit-Learn
5. tensorflow (2.x)
6. keras (2.14)
7. OpenCV (3.X) (opencv-contrib)

All these Neural Network models have been implemented very earlier on 200X year.These classic deep network models had laid foundations for further more advanced deep learning models like CNN, RNN, transfer learning and genrative models. 

The referred implementations may be used for pilot experimental setup for post-graduate and advanced research purpose.It is advised and suggested students, reserachers should implement them from scratch to get better experience and knowledge.For theory part, stay tuned for youtube channel "Giri-Yojan". (But it will take time). A few small notes with explanation with arts and mathematics will be shared with in short time period.

Meanwhile once again "Good Luck"

Thanks for the authors.

(Change the training and testing directory path accordingly)

Flower Dataset -
******Will be posted later***

2. GoogleNet for fruit classification

There is a doubtful error in the fruit classifcation part. So it is under preparaton for fixing those issues.
So meanwhile I have put flower dataset and tested. Later this will be fixed and updated here.

2. AlexNet for fruit classification and flower classification

## important notice
This deep nueral network model has been implemented in C/C++ and Python from scratch also. As in lot of places and repositories author has been suggesting to write the model from scratch, here is a small sample written in python. The forwrad network, back propgation along with utilities for data preprocessing has been written by refrerred author A. Esconrela in plain python and NUMPY package. The code has been ported by me as notebook implementation for further reference.First understand the architecture and then go for the detail implemnation in python. As I have suggested earlier for Machine Learning implementation, three programming environments are mostly preferred. 1. C/C++,CUDA 2. Python, CUDA and ML/DL frameworks 3. Matlab. All looks equal to me as for deploying to machine or device purpose.  For postgraduate and research students MATLAB is a very good tools for ML. MATLAB provides very good packages and block level or GUI level code builders those will immensly help to build Deep Learning Models easily. You can just plug and play those models. But it is costly, once gain you can get academic or student version.For big project and a good small team I will suggest to use MATLAB. Otherwise Python is the most popular one for using ML packages and libraries.It is equally capable of MATLAB level programming. In case of wrting custom models and newly developed DL/ML models, C/C++ or Python can be used. Anyhow it depends upon all on what are the requirements for project or ML softwares. 

(All the following model's theory part and core python code will pe posted soon)
For post graduate and research students they can start from this pilot experimental setup for advanced optmizations.Undergraduate students should understand the architecture from core of neural networks and try to reimplement them from scratch.

3. Resnet 34
This has been implemented in jupyter notebook. This is still in testing phase. But you can grab it, study theory from book or reference part.
