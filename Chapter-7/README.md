#This folder contains all types of Neural Network model.

The softwares needed for these implementations

1. Python 3.7
2. Numpy Library
3. Pandas Library
4. Scikit-Learn
5. tensorflow (2.x)
6. keras (2.14)
7. OpenCV (3.X) (opencv-contrib)

All these Neural Network models have been implemented very earlier on 200X year.These classic deep network models had laid foundations for further more advanced deep learning models like CNN, RNN, transfer learning and genrative models. 

The referred implementations may be used for pilot experimental setup for post-graduate and advanced research purpose.It is advised and suggested students, reserachers should implement them from scratch to get better experience and knowledge.For theory part, stay tuned for youtube channel "Giri-Yojan". (But it will take time). A few small notes with explanation with arts and mathematics will be shared with in short time period.

Meanwhile once again "Good Luck"

Thanks for the authors.

Fruit Dataset-

(Change the training and testing directory path accordingly)

Flower Dataset -
******Will be posted later***

2. GoogleNet for fruit classification

There is a doubtful error in the fruit classifcation part. So it is under preparaton for fixing those issues.
So meanwhile I have put flower dataset and tested. Later this will be fixed and updated here.
