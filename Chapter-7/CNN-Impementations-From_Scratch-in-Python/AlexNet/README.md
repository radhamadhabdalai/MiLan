AlexNet for image classification From scratch

1. For dataset unzip the *.gz files and change the path in the code.


## important notice
This deep nueral network model has been implemented in C/C++ and Python from scratch also. As in lot of places and repositories author has been suggesting to write the model from scratch, here is a small sample written in python. The forwrad network, back propgation along with utilities for data preprocessing has been written by refrerred author A. Esconrela in plain python and NUMPY package. The code has been ported by me as notebook implementation for further reference.First understand the architecture and then go for the detail implemnation in python. As I have suggested earlier for Machine Learning implementation, three programming environments are mostly preferred. 1. C/C++,CUDA 2. Python, CUDA and ML/DL frameworks 3. Matlab. All looks equal to me as for deploying to machine or device purpose.  For postgraduate and research students MATLAB is a very good tools for ML. MATLAB provides very good packages and block level or GUI level code builders those will immensly help to build Deep Learning Models easily. You can just plug and play those models. But it is costly, once gain you can get academic or student version.For big project and a good small team I will suggest to use MATLAB. Otherwise Python is the most popular one for using ML packages and libraries.It is equally capable of MATLAB level programming. In case of wrting custom models and newly developed DL/ML models, C/C++ or Python can be used. Anyhow it depends upon all on what are the requirements for project or ML softwares. 

####  Let us start. Good luck. ##########
