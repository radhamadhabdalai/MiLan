This repository is for brief explanation of knowledge and enlightenment behind Natural Langugage Processing(LLM).


Chapter -2. Notes on tokenization and embeddings
Chapter -3.  Notes for Transformer Architecture

Special Notes - Some topics are very vast and it is further advised to refer related materials. In Chapter-2, positional embeddings have been discussed very little. In Chapter-2, CBOW model is also described in one page only, you have to refer skip-gram models for understanding cbow model. Undergraduates are advised to do rigorous coding for these and not to use any third party libraries. Faculties . engineers, reserachers are hence advised to guide them to write these codes from scratch. They can refer furher research materials too. Postgraduates and reserach scholars may use libraries and advance tools for samoe of LLM tasks. But they should not use pretrained model. You will need a very highend infrastructure for this. So keep in touch and email me in any case,
